# Project Summary

## Overview
This project was a successful learning experience. I didn't finish all of the coursework that I set out to complete, but I did find the opportunity use what I learned in practice. I worked through nearly all of the LangChain Handbook with a pivot toward the end of the semester wherein I took what I learned and built software at work featuring a LangChain-based OpenAI integration. One of my original goals was to avoid getting trapped in tutorial repetition, and I'm happy to say I successfully made the leap from what I was learning to practical application.

## What I Learned
I successfully worked through five of the six chapters of the [LangChain Handbook](https://www.pinecone.io/learn/series/langchain/). During the course of this study, I learned to use LangChain to integrate models from HuggingFace and OpenAI. I learned how to use embedding from existing models to query local text documents with a natural language interface. 

## Challenges
I faced a few challenges during the course of this project. I started a new job at the beginning of the semester and struggled a bit to make sufficient time for the coursework. Fortunately, work and school became one in the case of this class. I also faced a couple of tactical challenges. First, LangChain is new and has a rapidly changing API. I often found myself hitting errors when following the tutorials. Tracking down the fix for these errors ultimately added to the learning and gave me a deeper understanding of LangChain implementation patterns. Lastly, given the popularity of LLMs, I often found the API key servers or model servers to be overloaded. Occasionally, I would have to make multiple attempts to complete a tutorial before getting successful responses from the busy servers.

## Conclusion
This felt like a near perfect learning experience to me. I tend to thrive on project-based learning, and the non-tutorial application that I completed during this project bolstered my learning experience. I was forced to work quickly with a technology that I was just learning, and this made me realize that my ability to build from scratch and piece together API integrations has matured dramatically throughout the course of the CSPB program.
