# Title: Practical Application of LLMs with Langchain

**Vision Statement:** I would like to gain a practical understanding of the LangChain framework for building applications with LLMs.

**Motivation:** Large Language Models (LLMs) are quickly gaining ground in a number of fields, and virtually every tech company is now trying to leverage them to improve their product or create new products entirely. I have found them useful for learning and integrated an open source sentiment model from Hugging Face for my project in Data Mining last semester. Additionally, I am helping a friend with their newly funded startup, which will lean heavily on the LangChain framework for development of LLM-based applications.

**Project Goal:** The primary goal for this project is to gain a working understanding of the LangChain framework. The project is intended to be firmly in the practical/applied space, but a secondary goal is to get a better understanding of the theory behind LLMs. I will gain a working familiarity with LangChain by:

* Reading through the LangChain docs
* Working through Pinecone's LangChain AI Handbook and accompanying videos on YouTube
* Building an example application using LangChain and one or more LLMs based on the examples from the handbook listed in objective two above
* The LangChain AI Handbook currently stands at eight chapters and growing. I will dedicate a week per chapter (including videos and exercises). I will front load the course by skimming the LangChain docs and continue to dive deeper into sections corresponding with the textbook topics. Finally, I will leave the last four weeks of the semester to finish building and documenting the example application. The schedule will be roughly as follows:

* Week 1: LangChain docs overview
* Week 2: Ch 1 - An Introduction to LangChain
* Week 3: Ch 2 - Prompt Templates and the Art of Prompts
* Week 4: Slack/Synthesis
* Week 5: Ch 3 - Building Composable Pipelines with Chains
* Week 6: Ch 4 - Conversational Memory
* Week 7: Ch 5 - Retrieval Augmentation
* Week 8: Slack/Synthesis
* Week 9: Ch 6 - AI Agents
* Week 10: Ch 7 - Custom Tools
* Week 11: Ch 8 - Agents With Long-Term Memory
* Week 12: Summary/Reflection

Note: The specifics of the application with be determined in the first few weeks of the semester with details added to the project outline

### Risks:

* Falling behind on coursework chapters or getting stuck in unfamiliar material and concepts
* Getting stuck in tutorial land without actually applying the concepts I've learned in a new context thus actually learning

### Mitigation Strategies:

* I am starting a new job and the risk of falling behind is very real. To mitigate this risk, I will schedule regular time slots to work through each chapter and document (with links) the specifics of what I covered each week
* I will begin the process of sketching out the application specifics early in the semester. This will accomplish two things:
* I will have a more specific idea and sense of where I need to focus in the docs/handbook


### Project Assessments:

* I will document each week's chapter in a github repo containing the work completed as I follow along
* I will document on the project site the specific readings/videos I work through each week
* I will document the app and complete either a recorded demo or a live site that will be accessible to the class. App development will be available via a Github repo.
