# Weekly Project Updates

### Week 9 (2023-07-17 -- 2023-07-23)
This was a hands-on application of learning week. I did not read a chapter or work through tutorials. I implemented exactly what I've been learning for a project at work. I used the LangChain library and OpenAI API to build a feature in an application that enables users to use embeddings from OpenAI to ask questions about local text files. The feature works really well and used nearly everything I have learned in this class so far this semester.

### Week 8 (2023-07-10 -- 2023-07-16)
I spent my time this week working through the second half of Chapter 4. As noted in last week's update, I hit a snag with Pinecone's free-tier servers. I was eventually able to auth this week, but then had to troubleshoot some problems. I was able to get through them. The issues were related to a mismatch between the Handbook content and the current state of Pinecone's API.

This was actually a good learning opportunity because I really had to dig into the docs to figure out how to replicate what was created in the handbook. I successfully completed all steps of Chapter 4.

### Week 7 (2023-07-03 -- 2023-07-09)
I read through all of the Chapter 4 content on "Fixing Hallucination with Knowledge Bases". I couldn't finish the last third of the jupyter notebook. Unfortunately, Pinecone's servers seemed to be overwhelmed, and I couldn't auth even after generating a new api key. I will try again this weekend or spring for a paid version.

### Week 6 (2023-06-26 -- 2023-07-02)
I am officially back on track this week. Given this is the mid-point of the semester, I am approximately halfway through the Langchain Handbook content. I spent the end of last week and this week getting caught up - including reading through Chapter 3 and working the accompanying examples in a code workbook that is committed to github.

### Week 5 (2023-06-19 -- 2023-06-25)
It was a scramble, but I caught up this week. I worked all the way through Chapter 3 of the Langchain handbook and completed Jupyter notebooks for all of the material. All updates are pushed to the github repo linked on my main page.

### Week 4 (2023-06-12 -- 2023-06-18)
I did not hit all of my goals this week. I was able to read through Chapter 2 of the LangChain handbook, but I did not complete a Jupyter notebook of the tutorial material.

### Week 3 (2023-06-05 -- 2023-06-11)
I started working through the LangChain Handbook this week. I read Chapter 1 and worked along in a Jupyter notebook. I created a GitHub repo to capture my progress through the text. The notebook I created for Chapter 1 can be found [here](https://github.com/ewhanley/langchain_handbook/blob/main/chapter_1.ipynb).


### Week 2 (2023-05-29 -- 2023-06-04)
This week was spent drafting the outline of the semester project proposal. The project will focus on learning LangChain. The initial draft project description was posted to Piazza for review.

Additionally, I made more progress on this website. Updates incluced adding the revised project description, this page containing weekly updates, and a placeholder page for a future github repo that will contain artificts created when I begin working on the LangChain handbook.

Finally, I skimmed the LangChain docs and handbook in preparation for working through the coursework in the LangChain Handbook.

### Week 1 (2023-05-22 -- 2023-05-28)
This initial week was spent coming up with a project idea and initializing this webpage
