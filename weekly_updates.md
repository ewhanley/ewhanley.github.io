# Weekly Project Updates


### Week 2 (2023-05-29 -- 2023-06-04)
This week was spent drafting the outline of the semester project proposal. The project will focus on learning LangChain. The initial draft project description was posted to Piazza for review.

Additionally, I made more progress on this website. Updates incluced adding the revised project description, this page containing weekly updates, and a placeholder page for a future github repo that will contain artificts created when I begin working on the LangChain handbook.

Finally, I skimmed the LangChain docs and handbook in preparation for working through the coursework in the LangChain Handbook.

### Week 1 (2023-05-22 -- 2023-05-28)
