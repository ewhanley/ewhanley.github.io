# Weekly Project Updates

### Week 6 (2023-07-03 -- 2023-07-09)
I am officially back on track this week. Given this is the mid-point of the semester, I am approximately halfway through the Langchain Handbook content. I spent the end of last week and this week getting caught up - including reading through Chapter 3 and working the accompanying examples in a code workbook that is committed to github.

### Week 5 (2023-06-19 -- 2023-07-02)
It was a scramble, but I caught up this week. I worked all the way through Chapter 3 of the Langchain handbook and completed Jupyter notebooks for all of the material. All updates are pushed to the github repo linked on my main page.

### Week 4 (2023-06-12 -- 2023-06-18)
I did not hit all of my goals this week. I was able to read through Chapter 2 of the LangChain handbook, but I did not complete a Jupyter notebook of the tutorial material.

### Week 3 (2023-06-05 -- 2023-06-11)
I started working through the LangChain Handbook this week. I read Chapter 1 and worked along in a Jupyter notebook. I created a GitHub repo to capture my progress through the text. The notebook I created for Chapter 1 can be found [here](https://github.com/ewhanley/langchain_handbook/blob/main/chapter_1.ipynb).


### Week 2 (2023-05-29 -- 2023-06-04)
This week was spent drafting the outline of the semester project proposal. The project will focus on learning LangChain. The initial draft project description was posted to Piazza for review.

Additionally, I made more progress on this website. Updates incluced adding the revised project description, this page containing weekly updates, and a placeholder page for a future github repo that will contain artificts created when I begin working on the LangChain handbook.

Finally, I skimmed the LangChain docs and handbook in preparation for working through the coursework in the LangChain Handbook.

### Week 1 (2023-05-22 -- 2023-05-28)
This initial week was spent coming up with a project idea and initializing this webpage
